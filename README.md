# Space Invaders Emulator

![Space Invaders Gameplay](gameplay.gif)

My emulator of the original [Space Invaders arcade machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders#Hardware), written in C++ and using SDL2 for display and buttons. It includes a complete emulator of the Intel 8080 CPU, which has been tested against [kpmiller's reference implementation](https://github.com/kpmiller/emulator101/blob/master/CocoaPart7-Threading/8080emu.c). It can also play other games on the same hardware such as variations like [Alien Invasion](http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/dettaglio_mame.php?game_name=alieninv&search_id=) and [Space Attack II](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9639), but only the original Space Invaders game has been thoroughly tested.

## Requirements

- For copyright reasons I can not provide the ROM file for the space invaders game. **You need to find and download the ROM file yourself and place it in the same directory as the executable.** The ROM can either be provided as one file (`invaders.bin`) or as four separate files (`invaders.e`, `invaders.f`, `invaders.g` and `invaders.h`).
- gcc
- SDL 2

## Usage

Once you have made sure that you have ROM file and SDL2, type `make run` into your favorite console to compile and run.

## Controls

Player 1 plays with the arrow keys and Player 2 with WASD.
